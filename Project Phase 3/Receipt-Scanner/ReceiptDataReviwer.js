/*

This class will be useful in the review and editing of the JSON data
from ReceiptDataExtractor. It will link to the UI to save any data changes
and update item/object properties.

I have interests to continue researching more on it in future
release versions and plan a sort of learning element 
so that the user never needs to edit the data.

/* 
//extracted receipt data as a Json file
JsonObject receiptData

class ReceiptDataReviewer {}
/* 
the constructor will instantiate the receiptData variable
*/


itemIterator(receiptData);

/* 
this method will iterate through every object in the receiptData 
and populate a textbox for the user for each object

a listener will track a save action by user and we'll update 
the current object. 
*** I am still considering a lot more on how this method will precisely work best.
