            ask user to verify ingredients used in recipe
            user will be shown a list of ingredients and their quantities in the recipe
            - this information will be provided by spoonacular api
            - it will be of the form [[ingredient, quantity], [ingredient, quantity]]

            create verifiedIngredients (return variable), which is equal to recipeIngredients

            user will then be able to update quantities of any items
            if user makes any changes to quantities:
                - store changes 
                - update quantities of ingredients in verifiedIngredients

            user will also be able to add/remove ingredients
            if user makes any changes to ingredients:
                - store changes
                - update ingredients in verifiedIngredients

            call reduceInventory() in the inventory-manager component
